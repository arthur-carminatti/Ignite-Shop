# Ignite Shop

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Welcome to the "Ignite Shop" project, part of the 'Ignite' course by Rocketseat. In this project, we used ReactJS with TypeScript and created the project using Next.js, a powerful web application framework. Additionally, we integrated the Stripe payment service to offer a complete e-commerce experience.

The Ignite Shop is a T-shirt e-commerce platform designed to provide customers with a seamless and secure shopping experience. Users will be able to select their desired T-shirt and make quick and convenient payments through the integrated Stripe service.
